Student Performance Prediction

Project Overview
This project analyzes student performance based on study hours, attendance, and exam scores. The goal is to visualize the relationship between these factors using Python and Matplotlib.

Features
- Scatter plot: Study Hours vs. Exam Score
- Line plot: Attendance vs. Exam Score
- Data visualization using Matplotlib
- Simple and easy-to-understand analysis

Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/divYansh-25/SStudent_Performance_Prediction__202401100400086
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd Divyansh_Yadav_202401100400086.ipynb
   ```
3. Install required dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas matplotlib
   ```

Usage
Run the Python script to generate visualizations:
```sh
python student_performance.py
```

Dataset
The dataset is manually created and consists of:
- `Study_Hours`: Number of hours a student studies per day
- `Attendance`: Percentage of attendance in class
- `Exam_Score`: Student's exam score (out of 100)

Visualizations
- **Scatter Plot:** Shows the relationship between study hours and exam scores.
- **Line Plot:** Displays the impact of attendance on exam performance.
